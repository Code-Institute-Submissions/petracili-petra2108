### <u>Scope of the project</u>

In today’s idea is to create a website for Amphora Pizzerias. In today’s situation with the coronavirus where most restaurants are closed, good promotion is key to keeping the restaurant in pole business and thus have preserved jobs. So this Italian restaurant needs a website where you will see the complete restaurant menu with an order form.

## Subpages

  I was create 3 subpages Home, Gallery and Contact. First one was home pages with 3 separate section, About Us, Menu of restaurant and Social Network links. 
  Secund subpages was Gallery with content listing photos of the food provided by the restaurant. 
  The third page is composed of information about the restaurant and the restaurant contact form.

### UX Design / Presentation

#### User Stories

###### As a visitor to the Pizzeria Amphora site I expect:

- To be presented with an appealing page using appropriate quality and format imagery.
- To be presented a responsive website that looks good on multiple form factors and screen sizes.
- To be able to find the information I am looking for.
- To be able to easily navigate on the page.
- To be able to execute the expected functions on all the included links and buttons.
- To be able to get in touch with the service provider.

###### As the operator of the Pizzeria Amphora site I expect:
  
- To provide basic information about EMM and it's services.
- The customers to read what was published in the press about EMM. (like customer testimonials)
- Visitors to easily navigate on the site not coming across any broken links or buttons.

#### Colour Scheme
-   As my choice for page style is an idea for industrial style, with 4 different colors.
      Dark orange on the background, white for menu frames, black letters and green shades for a slightly more interesting look.

####  Typography
-   To select syila letters I used the Google Fonts page which chose the desired font there, my choice was Castoro font.
     [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

#### Imagery
-    I found the photos I used on google and copied the photo link and used those images to create the page .

## CSS3

* to style, the files (index.html) I used one Bootstrap CSS Style file was cut and only the layout of the page was created in it using elements for arranging the page.

   ``` <style>
			
			a.navbar-brand{
				font-size: xxx-large;
				
			}
			
			nav.navbar {
				background-color: darkorange !important;
			}
			
			img.heroimage{
				width:100%;
				height: auto;
			}
			
			.aboutus{
				background-color: darkorange !important;
				color: black;
				
            }
            
            .aboutus div.container, .menu, .gallery, .contactpage, {
				background-color: darkorange !important;
				color: black;
				
			}
			
			.gallery img {
				height: 550px;
				width:100%;
				
            }
            
            .menubutton {
                background-color: darkorange !important;
                color: black;
            }
            </style>```
		

#### Classes and IDs

*  I added classes and id to each `<div>` where needed to make visual changes later in the style section, so 
  I have, black for the text. to make it more readable on an orange background that looks 
   vibrant and alluring and in keeping with the whole concept of the restaurant. Then we have a green submit button and social network icons to give importance to the section and to make it easier to see.


### Acknowledgements

### End 

-  I learned a lot working on this project, things I wouldn't have had the opportunity to do in my normal life. as this is my first station I have ever made I am pleased with its work and appearance. I would like to thank the entire Code Institue for their help and my mentor who helped me to better understand the work of a developer. I look forward to the next project and the new things that follow.
